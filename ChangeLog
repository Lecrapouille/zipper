    * Fix compilation issue for minizip and Windows preventing usage of AES.
    * Fix regression in minizip when updated: timestamp for Linux.
    * Breaking API:
        - introduce dummy constructor and open() methods
        - replace bool by enum for extraction
        - reduce public method names
        - allows operators & and | for zip flags.
    * New API:
        - Add glob pattern (extraction, entries)
        - Add callback for making progressbar.
    * Better prevention against zip slip attack.

Version 2.0.0:
    * Forked from https://github.com/sebastiandev/zipper v2.x.y branch.

    * Replace Catch by Google test. Add lot of non regression tests.
    * Fix all issues reported by users.
